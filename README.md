# Instructor: John Serences

## Location: Mandeville B-210

## Course description
This course will introduce new programmers to Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Experience in another language may help, but no programming experience is necessary as we'll start with the basics. 

Along the way you'll learn how to implement some simple statistical tests and general analysis techniques that many of you will encounter in your course work and in research projects.  

## Goal of the course
At the end of the course you should have a good understanding of the Python language and the Jupyter environment. We will also cover various packages such as NumPy and Pandas that are commonly used in data science. You should also have some knowledge about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Python and other common languages like Matlab. 

## Class time
Each class will consist of lectures and in-class coding where you can follow along. In sections you will cover problem sets that reinforce the topics covered in lecture. 

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this course. However, there are many intro books out there that you might find helpful, including the book below that is written for people who are new to python and programming in general. 

Title: Python crash course : a hands-on, project-based introduction to programming
Author: Matthes, Eric

## Exams

### Short Quizzes
Starting week 2: At the start of section there will be a short quiz with questions focused on topics from class (approx. 5-10 multiple-choice questions). These quizzes will be given online using google forms. 

Each of the quizzes will be worth 10 points.

You can drop two quizzes to give you some flexibility if you need to be late for a class or if you have other obligations that prevent you from preparing.  

### Midterm
There will be a midterm that will cover material from the first 1/2 of the class. The midterm will be worth 50 points. 

### Final Project
Instead of a final exam you will have a final project that will require you to generate code to address a novel problem. More details will be provided during 2nd week. The final project will be worth 80 points. 

## In-section problem sets
Each week there will be a problem set that you will work on in section and out of class. These assignments are meant to give you the hands-on practice that you need to develop fluency in the language. The problem sets will be graded weekly and will count for 50 points towards your final grade (i.e. same weight as the midterm). 

## In class participation and attendance
Class participation and attendance is worth 10 points. To give you some flexibility, you will receive the full 10 points if you attend 80% of the lectures. Attendance will be monitored based on responses to questions using iClickers. 

## Letter grade in course
Grades will be based on the percentage of points earned on the midterm, final project, attendance/participation, and problem sets. 

Letter grades will be assigned based on the following table:

A+ 97-100

A 93-96.99999

A- 90-92.99999
 
B+ 87-89.99999
 
B 83-86.99999
 
B- 80-82.99999
 
C+ 77-79.99999
 
C 73-76.99999
 
C- 70-72.99999
 
D+ 67-69.99999
 
D 63-66.99999
 
D- 60-62.99999
 
F 0-59.99999

### Grades will not be rounded.

## Academic Integrity

[From UCSD Academic Integrity office](https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/take-action/promote-integrity/faculty/syllabus-statements.html#General-statement-on-academic-i)

"Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."

[Please read the full UCSD policy](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)

This course will also make use of online quizzes and exams via Google Forms. This means that each of you will be sent an email and will take quizzes/exams online with your user_name@ucsd.edu email linked to your grade. Taking a quiz or exam logged in as another student will be treated as a violation and you will be referred for disciplinary action. Similarly, emailing with or otherwise communicating with other students or anyone else during a quiz or exam will be treated as a violation and also referred for disciplinary action.
